<h2><a href="/post/2/">Miss Thrifty</a></h2>
<p>One of the more popular frugal blogs in the UK, Miss Thrifty is targeting young mums with her money saving, frugal tips and articles. And rightly so! The market is massive and she’s meeting a need for this type of information. Young mums aren’t exactly rolling in cash. They may have had to give up work and are now relying on just one wage coming in, so the need to be more frugal with everyday living is a must.

The great thing about this blog is the conversational tone and the real person behind the brand. I think it’s inspiring to other mums to see someone like them making such a difference in other people’s lives by creating amazingly useful content that is 100% actionable. Also it may inspire mums to set up their own blog and to write about their experiences as a mother and a wife in the 21st century.</p>

<h2><a href="/post/3/">ADVICE FROM A TWENTY SOMETHING</a></h2>
<p>What It Is: A lifestyle blog by Amanda Holstein (who actually also writes now for The Everygirl), full of “advice for the modern girl” on everything from fashion to beauty, decor, relationships, blogging and more.

Why I Love It: Don’t be turned away by the title if you’re not a 20-something.  I recently discovered this blog, and have really been enjoying it in my thirties.  ;)  She has really cute style, and posts all sorts of genuinely helpful tutorials on all things stylish (from hair tutorials to skincare/makeup tips to fashion advice and more).  But then she also has some great blogging and career posts, as well as her trademark relationship advice posts.

Recommendations: Her skincare archives.  Everything in the real life archives.  Lots of really great styling advice.</p>

Approx. Subscribers: 846,000+

Run by ‘the Problogger’ himself, Darren Rowse, this blog is actually his real money maker, not Problogger.net.

This thing is an absolute monster, a huge blog in a very profitable niche. Lots of people buy cameras, and they’re expensive.

All of the tips that Darren writes about on Problogger are put into action here, so if you want to watch the Problogger at work, follow the strategies that this blog utilizes, rather than reading the next Problogger post.</p>
